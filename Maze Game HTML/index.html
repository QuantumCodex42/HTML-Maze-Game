    <h1>Welcome to Maze Game! Make the right choices to recieve your freedom</h1>
    <p>You awake in a strange room. It's cold, and made of stone. The only thing letting you see is the torch on the wall. You see a sign and it reads:</p>
    <h4>Welcome to my maze, find the exit, and reclaim your freedom. Otherwise be doomed to roam these halls till your bones collapse from exhaustion! Good luck :)</h4>
    <p>You exit this room and walk along the dingy, torchlit, stone halls. After some time, you see a fork in your path. One way leads to your left, and the other leads to your right. What do you do?</p>
